From Peggy's slides we should include on the project presentation: 

1. What is innovative about your project? How will you add to existing knowledge that we have about a subject, or how will your tool be novel when compared to other solutions? (literature review)
2. What impact could your project have? (on users, designers, researchers)

3. What roles will each member play? What tools will you use to track your contributions (in addition to commits/issues on GitHub)?

4. What methodology will you use for evaluating your contribution or during the course of your project?

5. What are the main milestones for your project? (specify these for each week). Grad students please ensure these are added to your GitHub project (milestones and issues).

6. What risks do you perceive? What will you do to mitigate those?
Note: feedback from the oral phase should be taken into consideration and addressed in the written proposal.
