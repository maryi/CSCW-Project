**Project proposal**

Introduction
 Introduction to the problem and the MoCA framework
 Motivation: Why is this important? 
 Research goal or questions
 1. Is the MoCa framework suitable to classify the tools?
 2. Are there other dimensions that should the added to the MoCA framework?
Background
 What is the MoCA framework?
 Preliminary literature review about the problem we are trying to solve 
 Outcomes -by the end
Strategy / Methods
 What are we going to do? how are we going to do it? 
 Technical specifications: Database support  - MySQL, Web server,  Programming language java
Expected results
Limitations
Future work 

From Peggy's slides we should include on the project presentation: 
1. What is innovative about your project? How will you add to existing knowledge that we have about a subject, or how will your tool be novel when compared to other solutions? (literature review)
2. What impact could your project have? (on users, designers, researchers)
3. What roles will each member play? What tools will you use to track your contributions (in addition to commits/issues on GitHub)?
4. What methodology will you use for evaluating your contribution or during the course of your project?
5. What are the main milestones for your project? (specify these for each week). Grad students please ensure these are added to your GitHub project (milestones and issues).
6. What risks do you perceive? What will you do to mitigate those?
Note: feedback from the oral phase should be taken into consideration and addressed in the written proposal.
