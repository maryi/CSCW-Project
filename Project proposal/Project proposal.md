**Project proposal**

1. Introduction

Computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) is increasingly becoming a significant component of living and working in modern times. Computer mediated collaborations occur in all aspects of our personal and professional lives. Furthermore, the technologies which can be used to facilitate CSCW are diverse and ever changing.  

The MoCA framework provides a descriptive lens for describing the complex nature of collaborative work with the goal of helping us understand the collaborative technologies which best facilitate the work. Our project explores whether articulating the type of work to be facilitated through the MoCA framework can help individuals select appropriate technologies. 

 2. Motivation: Why is this important? 

The study of CSCW is concerned with supporting multiple individuals working together mediated by computer systems and software. We believe the MoCA framework provides a useful lens for describing collaborate work. Our intent is to extend the MoCA framework to facilitate the next steps in decision support for choosing computer systems and software which support specific work scenarios. 

The appropriate selection of a suite of technologies which meets the needs of a group can have a great impact on the success of the collaboration (Olsen & Olsen, 2014). Technologies are often selected based on past experiences or accessibility. The selection of tools to support CSCW may occur without much consideration, and this presents a risk to success. By attempting to articulate the elements of the collaborative work which will be undertaken, a more thoughtful selection of appropriate tools may occur.

 3. Research goal or questions

We believe the MoCA framework provides a useful lens for describing collaborative work. As such the research question we seek to address in this study is: can articulation of collaborative work using the MoCA framework be used to assist in the identification of appropriate collaborative systems and software for facilitating collaborative work?  

As a secondary question we wish to investigate whether there are further descriptive dimensions useful in describing collaborative work that should the added to the MoCA framework?

2. Background
 1. What is the MoCA framework?
 
The Model of Coordinated Action (MoCA) framework is used for describing collaborative situations and consists of seven dimensions of coordinated action.

•	Dimension One: Synchronicity concerns a continuum of coordinated action ranging from being conducted at the synchronously, at the same time, to asynchronously, at different times. It allows coordinated actions to be both synchronous and asynchronous however it does not account for predictability of time.

•	Dimension Two: Physical Distribution whether coordinated actions are taking place in the same geographic location or at different geographic locations. It does not take into account the predictability of place.

•	Dimension Three: Scale addresses the number of participants involved in the collaboration. An increase in participants requires more complicated social arrangements and new practices.

•	Dimension Four: Number of Communities of Practice focuses on the number of communities of practice represented in the coordinated action. 

•	Dimension Five: Nascence discusses how un-established (new) or established (old) a coordination action is. 

•	Dimension Six: Planned Permanence refers to planned or intended permanence of a coordinated action because it cannot be predicted how long a coordinated action will last. 

•	Dimension Seven: Turnover refers to the stability of the participant makeup of a given collaboration, or the rapidity of participants entering or leaving the collaboration.

4. Expected results
5. Limitations
6. Future work 

From Peggy's slides we should include on the project presentation: 

1. What is innovative about your project? How will you add to existing knowledge that we have about a subject, or how will your tool be novel when compared to other solutions? (literature review)
2. What impact could your project have? (on users, designers, researchers)

3. What roles will each member play? What tools will you use to track your contributions (in addition to commits/issues on GitHub)?

4. What methodology will you use for evaluating your contribution or during the course of your project?

5. What are the main milestones for your project? (specify these for each week). Grad students please ensure these are added to your GitHub project (milestones and issues).

6. What risks do you perceive? What will you do to mitigate those?
Note: feedback from the oral phase should be taken into consideration and addressed in the written proposal.
