The survey ran from November 21 - November 28, 2015. In total 13 responses were received during the survey window. 

## Q1
**Imagine a recommender system developed to help users find the appropriate application to support collaborative work. Any user without registration could go into our system and, with the use of precise descriptors, provide a description of the work s/he intent to support. In return, the system will return those applications that match the user criteria. Would you use this kind service? Do you think it would be useful?**

Yes – 100%

** Can you elaborate on your answer? **

*	There are many tools and it is difficult to remain knowledgeable about what options are available.  The tool could help bring unknown tools to my attention.
*	I do a lot of group projects in school so it would be helpful
*	This seems like a pretty good idea- it's hard these days to find the best/most appropriate program for different projects. Another thing I could think of would be a similar site to help users find programs that help track/develop citations for essays.
*	It doesn't mean I would use whatever was recommended, but it would help get an informed search going.
*	Although I am not the most application-savy individual, having access to a tool that would suggest applications and services to enhance project performance would be of great use. Now, applications that I often use are based on word-of-mouth from friends and family and social media/advertisements.
*	It will help me find apps I can use for school
*	this sounds like a good idea, but i wonder how it's different than searching on the app store

## Q2
The vocabulary used to describe the work properties was clear?
Yes – 54%
No – 46%
Do you have any suggestions?

The site is text heavy and unnecessarily wordy and could convey its intentions a fewer words and simpler language.
•	overall it was good. But there were a couple that were off- one in particular was on the screen where I selected the timeframe for the project. The choices were something like "2 months or less" or "6 months or less"- if a project was 1 month, it could fit into both of those categories! Try "2-6 months" instead.
•	Some of the formatting made it hard to read the descriptors properly. 
•	The introductory text on the landing page could be clearer and more concise.  I'd suggest removing the descriptive words that tell us what you think about the service and just go with a very basic description of the service.
•	"I am not clear on private vs open collaboration - closed to the group vs open to the world?
•	I was not clear on the section called ""Purpose:"" I assume it is the purpose of the collaborative software.
•	I don't know what Mindmapping is or what Aggregators are."
•	"As the average individual in North America has a grade 6 reading level the vocabulary used for MatchMaker could be unclear at times. For example ""Domains"" could be replaced with ""Discipline"" or ""Area"". Additionally, ""Synchronous"" could be replaced, etc...
•	Perhaps there could even be a definition or example of the purpose when the cursor is placed over the phrase."
•	what do you mean by vocabulary? and what is the difference between that and descriptors?

## Q3
Do you think the set of descriptors for collaborative work is complete?
Yes – 77%
No – 23%
Do you have any suggestion?
•	"It would be useful to know what kinds of management options are supported by the tools.
•	The search option does not cover all of the input information about the tool."
•	When the results appear it would be nice to have a brief description of the site. 
•	Yes BUT- I don't think there was one for group school work - I think a general one would be good in there. 
•	I'm unsure what you mean by the 'descriptors for collaborative work'.  Do you mean the definition on the landing page or the questions in the application?
•	No.
•	"It may be beneficial to select tasks specifically related to the ""domains involved in collaboration"" for example: you could select engineering and then a list of activities could pop-up that would be beneficial/related to engineers.
•	Additionally, the aesthetics of the check-box areas were not visually appealing- the text alignment is not visually appealing."

Was there any descriptor that you consider unnecessary?
No – 100%
If yes, can you tell us which descriptor do you think is unnecessary and why?
•	Once again, unsure what descriptors you're referring too.
•	I am uncertain as I may not see the relevance that some domains have for specific descriptors.
Q4
How would you rate your experience searching for apps using the tool?
Good – 77%
Fair – 23%
Can you elaborate on your answer?
•	The search output and insert feedback pages could be better looking
•	Could be more streamlined. Simpler more precise languge would appeal to a broader audience outside of acadamia.
•	I found the flow was a bit confusing. 
•	The survey was easy to fill out.  Once through the survey, the information on the recommendation screen lacked context for me.  I had a list of four applications with an ordinal score, but no indication of why they were picked or if the score meant they were useful to me.  I checked out the applications listed and none were really useful for the fictional use case I had in mind while filling out the survey.
•	"I had some trouble with the purpose; also, once the search results are returned, I would like to see a brief description of the tool before I click the link.
•	I liked the look of the site and the tabs at the top and the menu. Navigation was good. Presentation and overall look was nice; although columns should be lined up for ease of reading.
•	I liked the ranking of the results and that they were linked to the product."
•	It may be beneficial to add Healthcare/Medicine as a domain.
•	The questions were clear and easy to answer
•	"i don't understand what it meant by the nature of collaboration.. what is the difference between open collaboration and open collaboration to public??

## Q5
Do you feel motivated to contribute to the database of MatchMaker app?
Yes – 23%
No – 77%
What could increase your motivation?
•	If I had knowledge of a tool that should be listed
•	I don't know that many apps so I can't contribute to the database.
•	I don't know enough about what is out there...
•	I don't have any apps to add. If I had developed an app I would be motivated to include it in the database.
•	If I was an app supplier, I would definitely be interested.  I don't know if I would do it altruistically for an app I used but didn't own a part of.
•	If your site was really successful and I knew a lot of people went there to choose their tools.
•	Uncertain what is being asked... Motivated to create an application that can be listed on Match Maker?
•	I'm still not sure why I would be the one adding apps to the database
•	it seems like this is more for people who develop apps..

## Q6 
The vocabulary used to describe the application properties was clear?
Yes – 69% 
No – 31%
Do you have any suggestions?
•	Refer to previous comments. The search page was nice and straightforward though.
•	No, the survey was easy to work through.
•	See comments on previous page.
•	The first paragraph under "What is Match Maker system?" may be irrelevant and confusing to the user. "Recommendation system" seems like a technological term...
•	I wasn't sure what you meant by learning curve and modality
•	No

## Q7
Do you think the set of descriptors for the application properties is complete?
Yes – 85%
No – 15%
Do you have any suggestion?
•	It's hard to limit the descriptors of an application to only a few terms. 
•	No, pretty clear.
•	See previous re. Healthcare/Medicine and engineering example.
•	No
Was there any descriptor that you consider unnecessary?
No – 100%
If yes, can you tell us which descriptor do you think is unnecessary and why?
•	Lots of descriptors are good because different people many think of the same thing in different terms.

## Q8
How would you rate your experience searching for apps using the tool?
Good – 70%
Excellent – 15%
Fair -15%
Can you elaborate on your answer?
•	Easy to fill out the survey, just the results were lacking an clarity and context.
•	i couldn't think of many apps to add

## Q9
Do you find this tool useful? Would you use it in the future (assume it has been refined)?
Yes – 100%

## Q10
•	Is there any other comments you would like to share with us about your experience with Match Maker app?
•	"More output options would be useful - e.g. list all tools for a given domain or modality.
•	Add a rating field where users could rate tools so that tools could be recommended by rating as well as features."
•	I think it is a great idea.
•	I think this tool has the potential to be useful with some refinement. As of right now I feel like you'll have a hard time motivating people to use it. It is a bit hard to use and people might get a bit confused. 
•	Nice start!  Your battle will be in making people aware of it.
•	I am glad that I could use the back button without losing what I had already entered. Navigation is great!
•	"I think the Match Maker idea is an excellent way to suggest applications to users who may not be aware of available resources.
•	This type of system could be helpful to additional areas; for example, studying applications related to subjects, etc."
•	"If you clearly explain why you're letting people add apps to the database i think people would want to contribute.
•	"i would use this tool only for searching and not for registering an app. it doesn't make sense to me that anybody can register an app, i think only develops should be allowed to do that.
•	i also think the checkboxes for some questions were hard to read because of the way they were spaced"
