#Collaborative process and Milestones
We used Slack for our group discussions and GitHub issues to track the project progress and keep our project oriented discussions.

Every Monday afternoon at 4:30pm we have a virtual meeting through Google Hangouts and every Wednesday we have a face-to-face meeting before class at 12:45pm.

#### About the descriptors
Our intent was to use the MoCA framework as a base, so that it would be used to describe both collaborative work and the features of collaborative tools. However, we discovered that we would need to consider some additional fields to describe collaborative tools. This resulted in some interesting conversations facilitated through Github as we wrestled with developing our lists. We discussed the need for a descriptor of what a tool actually does defined as 'purpose' ([See discussion on Github](https://github.com/maryi/CSCW-Project/issues/7 "See discussion on Github")). Bower's (2015) typology of collaborative software provides a base to populate this descriptor.  

Also in terms of decribing collaborative tools, we discussed the challenge of labeling a tool synchronous or asynchronous 
([See discussion on Github](https://github.com/maryi/CSCW-Project/issues/18 "See discussion on Github")). Using examples of tools we were using at the time to facilitate our own CSCW such as Github and Slack, we had a rich discussion about whether these tools were synchronous or asynchronous. Some felt that synchronous implied real-time voice and video communication, others felt that because the afformentioned tools are increasingly mobile and provide real-time notification and opportunities to respond, they could be labeled synchronous as well. These discussions helped form the basis of our descriptors articulated in the next section.   

### Milestones
We divided the work in multiple tasks and although everyone was encouraged to contribute to all components of the project and discussions, there was always someone assigned or self-assigned as main responsible.

#### Milestones Met
Below, we present a description of participants responsibilities and tasks so far. Also, we present the list of milestones achieved.

Krista: Edition of project project proposal, in charge of creating a base list of applications (work in progress). This list of applications will be used to populate our database once the development is ready. Access to the list is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trh6Pesxvv5aYfd_x7wXxGmR5k9Y5g7-wpFbezwqi8E/edit?usp=sharing)

Michael: Edition of project proposal, Research, literature review and documentation of project progress. Also, documentation of initial descriptors.

Eli: Mockup design, Database administration. Responsible for technical specifications in project report.

Maryi: Administration of GitHub site and control of project progress. Mockup design, Ethics application, -based on the group discussions- documentation of final version of descriptors.

Dustin: Web development. Responsible for technical specifications in project report.
